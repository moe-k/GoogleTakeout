Script to reorganize photos and videos taken from Google Photos takeout download

When exporting your photos and videos from Google Photos, Google makes you download all your photos and videos via segmented zip files which contain a mixture of photos and videos across many different zip files. This script will go through a given folder where you saved and uncompressed the zip files from your Google Photos and will recursively search and move your photos to a destination directory where you can have them all organized.
